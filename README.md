For our project 04 in order to compile and run our project you have to navigate to the DoctorsOfficeManager and then run the class. 
The main method for our project is DoctorsOfficeManager.java class. After compiling you will be greeted and asked to choose whether to login in or create an exisiting account. Once logged in you can finally use our calendar to either create, edit or delete an appointment. 
We have 6 other classes in this project. We have the Seller.java, User.java, Store.java, Appointment.java and Calendar.java classes. 
The Seller.java class extends User, a seller is a type of user that our program deals with...
The User.java class is a method that stores all information for each type of user. This information is mainly important for logging in and keeping identifying information. Information like the users username, password, first name, last name and email are stored into a file so that all the information is kept and not forgotten. 
The Store.java class this class allows users to create, edit and delete calenders...
The Appointment.java class allows appointments to be requested for the customer and it allows the seller to either approve or decline the appointments that each customer sets. Each appointment is an hour long and it hold the title, start and end time for each appointment to keep overbooking to a minimum. 
The Calendar.java class holds the calendar name, the description of the calendar and an array list of the appointments for that day.
